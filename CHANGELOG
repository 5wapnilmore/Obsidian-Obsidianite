## Version 1.0.2 (Oct 31, 2020)

After being writing and reading for hours myself, I find a few tweaks needed to be made.

So I did a lot of little and big tweaks to make Obsidianite theme have a better user experience.

I have also adapted to Obsidian's plugin standard of version naming convention, removing the "v".

Hope you all like this update, and please feel free to give me feedbacks! Happy note taking! 💎

### Tweaks 💎

+ Enhanced on the **BOLD** text, now using a gradient text color for amazing eye catchy experience, but not too much that will hurt our eyeballs.
+ Reworked on the major colors, reduced the use of pink-purple colors for better long term reading and writing. (The purple colors looks good at first, but after long writing and reading, it feels a bit too much of a highlight).
+ Obisidian title bar's text had changed to Obsidianite blue, just to stay overall color sync.
+ Changed the color of file icon next to the file title, again to stay overall color sync.
